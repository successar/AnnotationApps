"It was definitely worth viewing, I don't regret that. But also it was kind of ordinary. Something, that I would expect from a movie titled like that. Love story was nice to watch. Humour was involved, but nothing surprised or spooked me. Shooting, ""tough guys"" etc. ain't worth it any more.",negative,negative,don,shooting,nothing,love,,ain
"predictable Superb cast , more please ! If you can catch just about anything else written by Plater ( or starring these wonderful actors ) . For anyone who does n't know Plater has a real feeling for jazz , my recommendation is to see the 'Beiderbecke ' trilogy whenever you can . `` There 's three kinds of jazz - Hot , Cool and 'What time does the tune start ? ' ''",positive,positive,`,,,about,hot,!
The only positive thing I can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie I ever saw was called. It would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable...a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even.  Why would anyone want to produce such waste?  I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented.  Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point.  Anything else just doesn't make sense.,negative,negative,waste,.,worst,piece,good,the

I am very interesting in how the dinosaurs lived and died . I am also interesting in how the dinosaurs behaved . The color of the dinosaurs is also interesting to see and discovered . They think which color they had . The most interesting is why the dinosaurs died and what happened after that . BBC have made a brilliant series how the brilliant dinosaurs lived and died !,positive,positive,discovered,brilliant,brilliant,a,.,the
"I've seen worse films. This is bad but at least doesn't try to be good so it deserves a brief round of applause. It rest firmly in the realms of the low-budget B-movie sci-fi genre. It is a rubbish film but in a nice way and is certainly worth buying if it's in the bargain bin at your local supermarket. Awfully charming rather than just plain awful. The highlight for me is when Galaxina's lover goes to rescue her. Upon turning up she exclaims ""Bunnyfluff!"" which draws sniggers from his co-pilot. Sit back, get drunk, enjoy!",negative,negative,.,but,bad,.,is,is
"I guess I have to write something here , although I think my one summary says it all . I 'm not a huge Ted Danson fan ... nothing against the man , just has n't `` done it '' for me . This covers the predictable sides of Swift 's novel that were never covered before . You can tell the cast was having a wonderful time filming this .",positive,positive,,n,`,not,against,i
